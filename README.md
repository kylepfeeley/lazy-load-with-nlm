This is an example site to demonstrate the use of [Netlify Large Media](https://www.netlify.com/products/large-media/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=nlm-example-pnh&utm_campaign=devex) for managing source image assets and serving image transformations on-the-fly to populate different source images in picture elements.
